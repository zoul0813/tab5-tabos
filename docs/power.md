# Reboot and Shutdown

The `reboot` command immediately performs an orderly restart:

```sh
reboot
```

The `shutdown` command immediately requests orderly power-off:

```sh
shutdown
```

Both actions stop applications, close open descriptors, unmount storage, and stop
system services before the platform action. They do not support delayed execution.

Applications use the Linux-style API from `<sys/reboot.h>`:

```c
reboot(RB_AUTOBOOT);
reboot(RB_POWER_OFF);
```

Successful calls do not return. Tab5 reboot uses the ESP32-P4 reset mechanism. Tab5
power-off uses the board power-control signal; if external power keeps the device
energized, TabOS remains halted with its display and services off. The host simulator
closes on power-off and performs a complete in-process runtime restart on reboot. These
calls currently require no privileges because TabOS has no user or permission model.

## Battery Charging

TabOS enables Tab5 battery charging during platform initialization. Charger
control uses second PI4IOE5V6408 I/O expander at I2C address `0x44`, pin P7
(`CHG_EN`). If serial output reports charger-control failure, connect USB-C and
inspect hardware/API initialization before relying on battery runtime.

The `battery` command reports the combined battery and external-power diagnostic:

```sh
battery
battery charge on
battery charge off
battery fast on
battery fast off
```

Tab5 reads battery-rail voltage and signed current from the INA226 at I2C address
`0x41`. Positive current means battery discharge; negative current means charging.
Power preserves the same sign. Source is reported only when current direction makes
it unambiguous; near-zero current reports an unknown source. Percentage is a bounded
voltage estimate across the Tab5 battery's documented 6.0 V to 8.23 V range, not a fuel
gauge measurement.

Applications use `<tabos/battery.h>`. `tabos_battery_status_t.valid` identifies which
telemetry, source, state, and charger-control fields are meaningful. Callers must not
interpret fields whose matching `TABOS_BATTERY_VALID_*` bit is clear. INA226 read or
charger-control failures move registry device `battery0` to `fault`; a successful retry
restores `ready`.
